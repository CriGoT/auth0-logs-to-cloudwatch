 - `2`: Info messages
 - `3`: Errors
 - `4`: Critical errors

The `LOG_TYPES` filter can be set to:

- `s`: Success Login (level: 1)
- `seacft`: Success Exchange (level: 1)

- `w`: Warnings During Login (level: 2)
- `du`: Deleted User (level: 1)
- `fu`: Failed Login (invalid email/username) (level: 3)
